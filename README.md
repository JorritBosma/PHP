# PHP
Coding along with Jeffrey Way to learn the basics of PHP.

Will set up my own project very soon with the skeleton and basic skills I learned here.

# My First DI Container
A DI Container is another way to connect or bind stuff together. 
We defined two static methods: bind and get.
You can store a whole lot more in the container.
In this section we bound the config.php to the key config in the class App inside the array called $registry.
If I understand it correctly, we did the same for database, so actually we made two DI Containers in this section.
