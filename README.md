# PHP
Coding along with Jeffrey Way to learn the basics of PHP.

Will set up my own project very soon with the skeleton and basic skills I learned here.

Problem: declared vars from controllers/index.php are being passed on to views, but on about and contact controlelrs/views this is not the case. Why? I do not spot any difference whatsoever.
