# PHP
Coding along with Jeffrey Way to learn the basics of PHP.

Will set up my own project very soon with the skeleton and basic skills I learned here.

# Namespaces
Not very difficult. 
We namespace at the top, use classes which are from other namespaces below that and everything should work fine. Systematic approach.
Also, made an app-folder and changed some refs to it.
