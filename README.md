# PHP
Coding along with Jeffrey Way to learn the basics of PHP.

Will set up my own project very soon with the skeleton and basic skills I learned here.

# Refactoring into Controller Classes
This was another tough one. Phew!
We made a Pages-controller for pretty static pages and a UsersController for the form and displaying all the users.
We also changed a lot in the routes, the Router and in bootstrap. 
It was all higher level stuff and I will most definitely have to watch this video again. On the first watch though, I already saw the benefits of refactoring.
Almost everything we are doing has the purpose of making sure every file has a very explicit and defined responsibility, and that classes have functions which are both useful and making coding elsewhere more concise.
Every file should serve ONE purpose and delegate all other responsibilities to other files if possible.
