# PHP
Coding along with Jeffrey Way to learn the basics of PHP.

Will set up my own project very soon with the skeleton and basic skills I learned here.

# Forms
Quite a complicated section about routing GET and POST methods. Especially the direct-method in Router.php in the core is still a bit magical to me, but probably I'll get used to it by doing it and doing it again. And again. And again.
